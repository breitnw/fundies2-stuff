# RUSH HOUR!

How To Play:

Objective: Get the Red Car to the Exit!

Rules:
- The Red Car is the Player Car.
- The generated level, has various other cars and trucks populated onto the board.
- At any given point, only one "selected" car can be moved using the arrow keys in the
direction/orientation it is originally provided in. For example, a horizontal vehicle could only be
moved left and right, using the respective arrow keys. (not implemented as of HW5; for later)
- To move the vehicle, the user must first click on the vehicle using their mouse pointer. Once
clicked, the vehicle will light up in a bright yellow colour. This will indicate that the vehicle
has been "selected."
- After moving the vehicle, one must simply click outside the vehicle or on another vehicle to
"un-select" the given vehicle.
- The Exit is indicated as a tile with a dot on it, usually present as a gap in the outer boundary
of the board, i.e., The Wall.
- Once the Red Car reaches the Exit position, you've won the game!
- For more fun and puzzling levels, some boards may have multiple Red Cars and multiple Exits,
in which case, one must put every Red Car on an Exit in order to win the game!
