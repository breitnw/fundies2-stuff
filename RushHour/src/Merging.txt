# MERGING

We decided to base the merged implementation primarily off of Nick's work for HW5 while merging in
finer implementation details from Joseph's design. This is primarily due to extensibility concerns:
Nick's design was extensible enough as-is to address many of the HW7 requirements without major
changes. It already had support for placing walls anywhere in the grid and representing object areas
via the `Rect` class, and supports requirements that may be salient in the future as well (e.g.,
dealing with multiple player cars and exits)

However, for some of the finer details (namely, those involving the switch to ArrayLists) Nick's
implementation was a bit less extensible, so we chose to merge in aspects of Joseph's
implementation. For instance, the use of a boolean value on each car for selection proved fairly
difficult to work with; meanwhile, Joseph's solution of storing a selection index is cleaner and
works much better with ArrayLists.

Additionally, we decided to merge our parsing implementations together. We wanted to maintain the
way Nick's implementation parsed Levels from the constructor; however, we also wanted the
simplicity of Joseph's implementation in how it parses the vehicles, walls, and exit all from
within one function. // TODO
